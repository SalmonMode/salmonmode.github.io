I look for problems in the code, and problems that lead to problems in the code. I love studying social systems and how their dynamics play into the quality of the software we produce, but also how that quality plays back into social systems.

### How did I get here?

I started working in IT right out of college, but didn't have a lot going on each day on the job, so I started looking for ways to help improve the workflows of the people I worked with. I knew some basics for programming, but was never formally taught, save for a couple introductory-level courses here and there, so building custom tools for them presented an actual challenge for me. At the very least, it was more engaging than fixing printers and troubleshooting Wi-Fi connectivity issues.

From there, I got a job in QA Automation, and made just about every mistake that everyone else does. I stumbled along for a few years learning everything I could about "automated tests", the tools used to write them, and software engineering in general. I also spent a good deal of time trying to help others avoid making the same mistakes I made.

Eventually, I realized that something wasn't right with how we were trying to build software. I noticed patterns in the problems that seemed to be in most software companies. The code always become unweildy, which would lead to more defects as well as lower productivity. So I turned my attention to trying to spot these problems and raise concerns about them before things got worse. But my warnings went unheaded.

When I started looking into why it seemed no one was focusing on this very clear problem, I noticed the much bigger problem. Few, if anyone, really *understood* why they were working the way they were. Sure, they'd learned aspects of it by rote, but when I asked why things weren't going well if this was how they were supposed to be done, I'd always be told some variation of "this is what everyone does" and "that's just the nature of software development." Quite often, I'd also be told "we're just unlucky."

But luck couldn't be all there was to it. I could see how in their rush to write more code they were making more problems for themselves. I couldn't understand why they were trying to rush everything, when they could take their time, be careful, and make more _real_ progress. Was I wrong in that assumption? Was "Agile" really about going fast and breaking things?

So I started reading up on it. I read the manifesto, and the other works by its authors (papers, tweets, blogs, etc). I even asked some of them directly (apparently that's an option). I also started talking to others in the industry who had noticed the same things I had, and were far more well-read than I, like Michael Bolton.

Turns out, it was all Waterfall the whole time. People were still relying on handoffs. Few, if any, were actually following the intentions behind the Agile manifesto.

So now, I use this knowledge to help expose the social problems that lead to the sorts of problems I'd been noticing.
