I'm just someone passionate about automation and programming (among other things), who strives to get things done the \*best way possible.

###### \*what may seem to be the best way now may not be the best way 6 months from now, and perception of the best way at any current moment is subject to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, experience, context, time constraints, project longevity, chosen IDE, how long the problem has been stared at, and how much sleep was had the night before

### How did I get here?

I started working in IT right out of college, but didn't have a lot going on each day on the job, so I started looking for ways to help improve the workflows of the people I worked with. I knew some basics for programming, but was never formally taught, save for a couple introductory-level courses here and there, so building custom tools for them presented an actual challenge for me. At the very least, it was more engaging than fixing printers and troubleshooting Wi-Fi connectivity issues.

From there, I got a job in QA Automation, and made just about every mistake that everyone else does. I stumbled along for a few years learning everything I could about automated tests, the tools used to write them, and software engineering in general. Now I'm an SDET who spends his free time helping others avoid the same mistakes (and learning about some of the mistakes I'm still making).
